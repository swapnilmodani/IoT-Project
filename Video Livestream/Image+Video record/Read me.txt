What does the code do?
- It uses open CV to record live videos using a webcam.

How does it work?
- The output is defined first as a video with the needed resolution.
- While the camera is open, the code returns the read frames and adds them to the video
- If the user presses space, a picture is captured and saved.
- As long as the user didn't press ESC, the recorded video is saved and all the used windows are closed.
- When the user presses ESC, the pictures and the video are saved.
